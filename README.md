# Software and system transparency - Common Lifecycle Enumeration (TC54-TG3)

<!-- Scope, POW copied from https://ecma-international.org/task-groups/tc54-tg3/ -->

## Scope

Ecma TC54-TG3 is chartered with the standardization of the Common Lifecycle Enumeration (CLE), an open specification designed to support the aliasing of components and communicate lifecycle events such as end-of-life (EOL), end-of-support (EOS), and changes in component provenance over time. The CLE will provide a structured and machine-readable format to communicate lifecycle events and milestones for software and hardware components. The scope of this task group will include:

* **Standardise Lifecycle Event Tracking**: Develop a consistent, machine-readable format for communicating lifecycle events (such as end-of-life, end-of-support, and component aliasing) that can be easily integrated into supply chain security tools and processes.
* **Resolve Component Aliasing Issues**: Create a framework to address the challenges of component aliasing, ensuring that software and hardware components are accurately identified across different lifecycle stages, even when names, manufacturers, or distributions change.
* **Ensure Compatibility with Existing Standards**: Align CLE with existing standards (e.g., PURL, VERS, CycloneDX, TEA) to ensure interoperability and widespread industry adoption of lifecycle event tracking.

## Programme of work

1. To develop a standard for the CLE specification.
2. To develop a prototype framework to resolve component aliases, ensuring accurate tracking of changing identifiers and names.
3. To develop and publish best practices for successful CLE adoption and integration with existing tools and standards.
