     - Schema for validating CLE document syntax (`schema/cle-1.0.0.schema.json`)

     - Follow-up from 2026-01-22: valid identifier types (PURL, CPE, SWID, GAV, etc.) and canonical casing

3. 2026 Goals Progress
   - Tooling development for CLE
   - Outreach to big projects

## Attendees:

- Jordan Harband
- Mark Symons
- Steve Springett
- Michael Herzog
- Przemyslaw Roguski
- Benji Visser

## Notes:

- **Tea 1.0** will include CLE support.
- Reviewed the blog post; target is to get it out this quarter.
- Add license change events before the June GA; we can review other events later.
- We should have a JSON schema completed.
- **Hardware identities (Steve)**: We will need to support hardware identities; it’s not as simple as a PURL. Steve recommends supporting all **GS1** standards—**GMN** (Global Model Number). And **G10**—all the links (which are basically UPC labels). He also recommends supporting a complex object of undefined keys and values (e.g. lot number, etc.) that can identify hardware.

## Action Items

- **Steve**: Will get the domain for the schema. Once we have the schema, we can point to https://tc54.org/schemas/ecma427/v1.0.0.json

## Next meeting agenda

- Look into a yanking license event: sometimes you publish a license and need to modify it after.
