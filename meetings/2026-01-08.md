## Attendees

- Benji Visser

## Notes

- The blog article should explicitly state that it would be great to have tooling to convert CLE to OpenEoX document in the future.
- **2026 goals**
  - Build tooling for CLE; target ~3 high-profile projects using it.
  - CLE adopted by TEA this year, ratified in late summer (September cutoff for December GA).
- Steve: It makes sense to wait for adoption to drive changes, but only if there isn’t regulation that forces us to change. We should get a CLE expert to help us build the spec.
  - Jordan: We think adoption will surface CRA issues.
- Moving CLE to monthly meetings.

## Action Items
- Jordan and Benji to work on the blog post.
