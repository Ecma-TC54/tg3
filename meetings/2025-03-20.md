## Notes:

- **Extended Support Options**
  - Discussion on enabling extended support for different software types.
  - Third-party support (i.e. one provider supporting a product not manufactured by them) was ruled out.
  - Explored representing support levels in the schema. Debate between using integers (implying hierarchy) versus unique support IDs or enums.
  - Recognized that support might not always be hierarchical and that inserting new levels later may be necessary.
  - Agreed on the importance of explicitly asserting both “support provided” and “no support” to avoid ambiguity.

- **License and License Change Events**
  - Considered including a license field in publish events to capture the starting point of a product’s licensing.
  - Discussed the value of a license change event for scenarios where the license shifts post-release.
  - Noted that while open source ecosystems (like NPM) have built-in mechanisms, including license information can help when declarations differ from license files.
  - Agreed that additional metadata (e.g. homepage, GitHub URL) could be attached, but license remains a core field.

- **Schema and Versioning**
  - Reviewed ideas around the JSON schema for the CLE specification.
  - Recommended using the latest JSON schema (e.g. draft 2020-12) and ensuring proper use of `$schema` and `$id` fields.
  - Debated whether the CLE version should be included in the schema URL or as a separate field, noting potential risks of version mismatches.
  - Consensus leaned toward a single source of version truth to avoid boilerplate and misalignment.

- **Additional Considerations**
  - Discussed sustainability and custodianship events for open source projects.
  - Mentioned that while some events (e.g. forking, change in primary maintainership) may be critical for open source, these might be deferred to a future version (v2).
  - Addressed legal requirements from the Cyber Resilience Act regarding end-of-update availability (e.g. software must remain downloadable for 10 years after publication or 5 years after support ends). There was discussion on how best to capture this information for downstream users.
  - Overall focus remains on creating a CLE spec that provides actionable, unambiguous support status and licensing information.

### Action Items

- **Support Schema**: Refine support level representation (integer vs. unique ID/enum).
- **License Metadata**: Add license field in publish events and define a license change event.
- **Schema Versioning**: Finalize versioning strategy (URL vs. top-level field) for consistency.
