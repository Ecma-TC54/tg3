  - [Meeting invite](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MGNlbWgwcDdoYWtwbjhvZ[â€¦]4f08c63792f2e654f2a7ebc%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL)

## Agenda items

- CPE support?
- Are support definitions required? when?
- Can support definitions be updated? can everything outside events be updated?
- The CLE `definitions.support` entries are timeless + global, but RHEL's policies are version-scoped and sometimes additive. Should we be able to support semantic drift in support definitions? For example, RHEL 7 has two maintenance phases, but was collapsed to one in RHEL 8.
- We need an identifier field of some sort at the top level of the CLE document?
- Should endOfLife have a supportId?

## Attendees:

- Benji Visser
- Jordan Harband
- Salve J. Nilsen
- Steve Springett

## Notes:

- The semantics of a support policy should not drift over time for a given support policy (at least for CLE v1).
- `updatedAt` should be at the top level of the CLE document.
- The order of keys should be consistent across all levels of the CLE document. (check whether JSON schema allows this).
- Support definitions are optional unless you have an event that requires them.
- Immutability. Each specific event is immutable. And the ordering of events across shards is immutable.
- `support.id` is immutable, and the implied semantics of a support policy.
- Identifiers can be an array, but only of the distribution is the exact same bits. The identifier(s) should not have a version string. Qualifiers are allowed.
- Identifiers should be PURL only for now.

## Action Items

- Benji: retroactively update the CONSTRAINTS.md file to reflect the decisions made during creation of the CLE spec
- Benji: PR #3 fully merged. Move spec to the _real_ repo
- Jordan: EC markup done by Jordan (after Benji moves spec)
