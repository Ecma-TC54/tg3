## Notes:

- TC54 voted to submit CLE to ExeCom for subsequent General Assembly ratification in December! Thank you Jordan for the presentation!
- We discussed the most important next steps for the CLE spec and decided it fell into two categories; 1) Integrating CLE 2) creating supplementary materials

### Integrating CLE

We can work on integrating CLE in different ecosystems and products. Ideas we discussed:
- NPM
- Dependency Track
- deps.dev

### Supplementary materials

We can create supplementary materials for the CLE spec. All the supplementary materials should be made available in the first week of December.
Ideas we discussed:
- JSON schema examples
- fleshing out the non-normative parts of the spec
  - why people should care + introduction
- Best practices PDF (similar to CycloneDX guide)
  - We can use https://github.com/CycloneDX/guides with markup to generate a guide like was done for CycloneDX (https://cyclonedx.org/guides/OWASP_CycloneDX-Authoritative-Guide-to-SBOM-en.pdf)
