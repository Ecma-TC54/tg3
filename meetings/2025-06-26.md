## Notes:

### Topics Discussed

1. **Event model review** – follow-up on dropping "End of Guaranteed Support" and folding it into the support object.

2. **"End of Marketing" event** – debated value, producer incentives, and possible regulatory (e.g., FDA) requirements.

3. **"Superseded By" event** – clarified two use-cases:
   - version-to-version within the same product;
   - migration to a different product;

4. **End-of-Support vs End-of-Life vs Distribution**
   - Current confusion for OSS vs commercial software.
   - Proposal:
     - **End of Support (EOS)** – terminates specific support-level(s) (array supportIds). Required only when more than one tier exists.
     - **End of Life (EOL)** – complete cease of fixes/communication for all tiers.

5. **Types-of-Work taxonomy** – add Substantial Modification (CRA recital 41 wording) to cover major/breaking changes.

6. **Open EOX white paper** – surfaced; group should review for interoperability.

### Decisions / Consensus

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| 1 | Keep EOS and EOL as separate events; EOS scoped by supportIds. |
| 2 | Add an EOD concept (exact form TBD) to capture cessation of artefact distribution/updates. |
| 3 | "Superseded By" will gain:<br>• single version (range-capable) field<br>• optional targetPURL when pointing to a different product |
| 4 | Expand Types of Work with Substantial/Significant Modification term (CRA language). |
| 5 | End-of-Marketing left pending—keep out of v1 unless FDA (or other) mandates confirmed. |
