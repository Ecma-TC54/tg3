## Agenda items

## Attendees:

- Mark Symons
- Salve J. Nilsen
- Steve Springett
- Benji Visser
- Jordan Harband

## Notes:

- **Support option enhancements**: The support option should include a URL field for providing support information and resources to users.

- **Terminology clarification**: Agreed to use "substantial modifications" terminology instead of "Feature Development" to better reflect the nature of significant changes to software components.

- **New event type**: Added "endOfDistribution" as a new lifecycle event to track when software distribution ceases.

- **supersededBy event refinement**: Added guidance that the "supersededBy" field should only be used in cases where version progression is not implicit or when dealing with non-semantic versioning schemes. This helps clarify when explicit supersession relationships are necessary versus when they can be inferred from version ordering.

- **Support vs End-of-Life distinction**: Clarified that "endOfSupport" should only exist when there are defined support levels. Otherwise, "endOfLife" should be used as the appropriate lifecycle event.

## Action Items

- Update specification to include URL field for support options
- Replace "Feature Development" terminology with "substantial modifications" throughout documentation
- Implement "endOfDistribution" event type in schema
- Add guidance documentation for "supersededBy" usage patterns
- Review and update event type definitions to clarify endOfSupport vs endOfLife usage

### Next Meeting
