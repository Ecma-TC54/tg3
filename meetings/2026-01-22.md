     - Define list of valid identifier types
       - Currently the spec only shows `PURL` in an example but doesn't enumerate valid types
       - Should we constrain to known schemes (PURL, CPE, SWID, GAV, etc.) or leave open-ended?
       - Clarify canonical casing (PURL vs purl)

## Attendees:

- Rogue

## Notes:
- we should look into a yanking license event. Sometimes you publish a license and need to modify it after.
- Steve will be getting the domain for schema once he's back from FOSDEM. Once we have the schema, we can point to https://tc54.org/schemas/ecma427/v1.0.0.json
