## Attendees:

- Mark Symons
- Salve J. Nilsen
- Steve Springett
- Benji Visser

## Notes:

### **1. PR Updates on Specification**
- RFC timestamp discussion:
  - Agreement to use the same standard JSON Schema follows (ISO standard).
  - Mark to update the timestamp format accordingly.
- Schema field discussion:
  - Possibility of including a `schema` field pointing to a JSON object defining the schema version.
  - Benefits: IDE/editor integration and validation.
  - Concerns: Potential domain hijacking if URLs are used.
  - Resolution: Schema field will be a name (not necessarily a URL) and can be registered in the JSON Schema Store for better editor support.
- JSON Schema versioning discussion:
  - CLE should choose the latest draft that has broad adoption.
  - Benji to research the most widely supported JSON Schema version.
- Review of event object structure:
  - Versions and version ranges:
    - Current implementation has `versions` and `ranges` as separate properties.
    - Proposal: Unify them into a single property, using explicit objects.
    - Alternative approach: Use an array of objects, each containing either a version or a range.
  - Agreement to refine structure to reduce confusion.
  - Discussion on ecosystem-specific version parsing challenges (e.g., npm, Debian, RedHat, etc.).

### **2. Extended Support Discussion**
- Extended support can be offered by third parties beyond the original manufacturer.
- Examples: Red Hat, Oracle, third-party software vendors.
- Open-source projects could also benefit from third-party extended support.
- Agreement that for v1, CLE will focus on first-party support with potential for expansion later.

### **3. Package Manager and Distribution Considerations**
- Need to ensure CLE adoption in package managers.
- Potential approaches:
  - Use `.well-known` paths (e.g., `.well-known/cle` similar to `.well-known/sbom`).
  - Define naming conventions for CLE files (e.g., `cle.json`, `productname-cle.json`).
- Reference implementation discussion:
  - Potential for testing CLE on real-world software products.
  - Hackathon in May at OWASP Barcelona as a testbed for CLE.
  - Interest in involving commercial vendors (e.g., Oracle) in the testing phase.

### **4. Action Items**

- Review and finalize the specification details.
- Conduct research on JSON Schema compatibility.
- Plan for CLE integration testing and hackathon participation.
- Continue discussion on extended support in the next meeting.
