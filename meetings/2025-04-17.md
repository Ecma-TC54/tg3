## Agenda items

- Review `endOfGuaranteedSupport` - "to me "guaranteed" implies some kind of contract, but open source doesn't have any guarantees - maybe there's a better term to use here?"
- Jordan - "`endOfSupport` and `endOfLife` feel equivalent to me. what's the difference?"
- Jordan - "why is `endOfMarketing`  interesting to anyone?"
- Jordan - "`supersededBy` - isn't every version of a component superseded by all future versions? what's an example where this event isn't always implied?"
- Review support IDs
- Review license metadata
- Review schema json

## Attendees:

- Mark Symons
- Salve J. Nilsen
- Steve Springett
- Benji Visser
- Jordan Harband

## Notes:

- We discussed the MVP scope and agreed to the following:
  - Open‑source focus for December release: cover full suite of open‑source life‑cycle events.
  - Design extensibly so commercial, OS‑level, medical‑device, hardware use cases can be fast‑follow enhancements (v1.1, v2.0).
- we discussed the events: `endOfGuaranteedSupport` and `endOfMarketing`
  - Remove “end of guaranteed support” and “end of limited support” as top‑level event types as they make the top level events more complex and confusing.
  - Potentially track support‑level variants via an attribute (e.g. supportGuarantee: { type: "FDA‑24m" }) on a generic endOfSupport event.
  - `endOfMarketing` - Recognized as niche but valid (e.g. M&A scenarios where marketing halts before support decisions). Keep as a top‑level event; add clarifying guidance in spec or best‑practices doc.

## Action Items

- Benji - remove the top level event `endOfGuaranteedSupport`
- Benji - reword the descriptions of events so that they are less confusing
- Benji - create a book of test cases across different dimensions (open source, commercial, OS, medical device, hardware)

### Next Meeting

- review updated spec
- review book of test cases
- review supersededBy event
