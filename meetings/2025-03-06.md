## Notes:

### Timeline Review
- Reminder that the deadline to submit to TC54 is August 1st
- Approximately 9-10 meetings remain before the August deadline

### Documentation Update (Steve)
- We use EC markup for the specification
- EC markup PR from Aki was merged (v21)
- Currently experiencing build issues with v21, working with Aki to resolve
- Need to start populating specification content in parallel with schema development
- Jordan is an expert resource for EC markup questions

### Extended Support Discussion
- Focus on first-party support (manufacturer offering support for their software)
- Third-party support is out of scope, i.e. Red Hat, Oracle oferring support for another vendors products
- Discussion on support levels representation:
  - Support levels vary by manufacturer (naming, number of levels)
  - Support levels can change over time for products
  - Need to consider how to represent both general and personalized support info

### Schema Architecture Options
- Proposal to add "definitions" property for reusable objects like support levels, similar to how CycloneDX does it
- Alternative: add high-level "support levels" object
- Trade-off between duplication and versioning complexity
- Consideration for support policies (e.g., "we support last 2 major releases")
- Different needs for commercial vs open-source software

### Additional Considerations
- Need to differentiate between effective dates and expected/predicted dates
- We need to potentially communicate release cadence information for open source projects
- Potential for policy objects to express support rules, i.e we only support n-1 versions

### Hackathon Update
- Room reserved for approximately 20 people
- Scheduled for Wednesday before AppSec Global
- Potential co-sponsorship between OWASP and ECMA
- Free to attend (conference attendance not required)
- Marketing materials being developed

### Action Items
- Benji to work on schema updates for extended support
- Benji to start populating specification content
